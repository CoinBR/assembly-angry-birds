No images, fonts, character, IP, or any asset used in this game belongs to me.
It's just a basic school project; I'm not looking for money or fame with this.
That said, you cannot use any asset of this game, without permission of their owners.

For convenience, the Mars .jar file was added to the project. I do not own it either.
You may check its license at http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/license.htm

Also, you're not allowed to use in Braulio's class (At IFRN Natal Central), the python script I wrote.
The script gets images and generate the assembly code necessary to display them in Mars' MIPS Simulator.
If you do so, it will be plagiarism, and Braulio will be mad with me x)

However, for the code, story, ideas and all other shit that came from me, the following license applies:
